# Card Survival Map Navigator

A CLI tool to help players navigate and manage locations in Card Survival game. This project was primarily developed with the assistance of AI (specifically, using Anthropic's Claude).

## Why This Tool?

Card Survival is a game of exploration and discovery, where uncovering new locations and resources is a key part of the experience. This tool was created to enhance that experience by:

- Letting you document your own journey without spoilers
- Helping you remember locations and resources you've personally discovered
- Creating your own personalized map as you explore the game world
- Maintaining the excitement of discovery while having a reliable way to track your findings

Instead of looking up complete maps online that might spoil the game, this tool lets you build your knowledge gradually. As you explore in-game, you can:

1. Add new locations as you discover them
2. Note down resources you find at each location
3. Track connections between areas you've explored
4. Find your way back to resources you've previously discovered
