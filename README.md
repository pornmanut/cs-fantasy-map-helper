# Card Survival Map Navigator

A CLI tool to help players navigate and manage locations in Card Survival game. This project was primarily developed with the assistance of AI (specifically, using Anthropic's Claude).

## Why This Tool?

Card Survival is a game of exploration and discovery, where uncovering new locations and resources is a key part of the experience. This tool was created to enhance that experience by:

- Letting you document your own journey without spoilers
- Helping you remember locations and resources you've personally discovered
- Creating your own personalized map as you explore the game world
- Maintaining the excitement of discovery while having a reliable way to track your findings

Instead of looking up complete maps online that might spoil the game, this tool lets you build your knowledge gradually. As you explore in-game, you can:

1. Add new locations as you discover them
2. Note down resources you find at each location
3. Track connections between areas you've explored
4. Find your way back to resources you've previously discovered

This way, you get the best of both worlds - the thrill of discovering new locations yourself, while having a reliable system to remember what you've found.

## Features

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/card-survival-map-navigator.git
cd card-survival-map-navigator
```

2. Install the package in development mode:
```bash
# Install with all development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or install only runtime dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

1. Start the program using the installed command:
```bash
card-survival-map
```

2. Create a new map or load the example map:
```bash
# Create example map
python -m src.infrastructure.cli.example_setup

# Then in CLI:
load example_map.json
```

3. Basic commands:
```bash
# List all commands and categories
help

# Create a new location
add_location Forest wood,berries

# Move to a location (interactive if no location specified)
goto
# Or directly:
goto Forest

# See current location info
look

# Find nearest resource (interactive if no resource specified)
nearest
# Or directly:
nearest wood

# Find resource locations (interactive if no resource specified)
find

find wood

# Find path to location (interactive if no location specified)
path
# Or directly:
path Mountain

# Save your map
save my_map.json
```

Interactive Features:
- Commands that require locations or resources can be used without arguments
- When no argument is provided, you'll get:
  - Numbered list of available options
  - Can enter either number or name
  - Fuzzy matching for misspelled names
  - "Did you mean?" suggestions
  - Easy cancellation with Enter or Ctrl+C

    class GameMapService {
        +locations: dict
        +resource_locations: dict
        +current_location: str
        +create_location()
        +add_resource_to_location()
        +find_path_to_resource()
        +save_map_to_file()
        +load_map_from_file()
    }

    class Location {
        +name: str
        +resources: list
        +connections: dict
        +add_resource()
        +remove_resource()
        +add_connection()
        +get_connection()
    }

    class Direction {
        <<enumeration>>
        NORTH
        SOUTH
        EAST
        WEST
    }

    class MapRepository {
        <<interface>>
        +save_map()
        +load_map()
        +list_maps()
    }

    GameMapService --|> LocationRepository
    GameMapService --|> ResourceRepository
    GameMapService --|> LocationProvider
    GameMapService --> Location
    Location --> Direction
    GameMapService ..> MapRepository
```

The architecture ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns through layered design
- Domain-driven design with core entities and business rules
- Dependency inversion through interfaces
- Modular and extensible feature organization
- Clean data flow through well-defined boundaries
